# Can of Books

**Author**: Connor Boyce
**Version**: 1.0.0 This first version is adding the basics of a login using auth0 to allow users to be authenticated when getting into their account to make changes.

## Overview
This Application will allow user to login to their own personal accounts to have the ability to archive lists of their favorite books. This could be books that are saved within a database and then unpacked for the user when they would like to see their favorite book lists.

## Getting Started
1. The user must make a React applciation first, following with getting the neccessary installs with npm, express, axios, etc.

2. Once this is done you can then go ahead and start with making an account with auth 0 in order to get yourself started ith setting up a user aithentification system.

3. Finally following steps to having the routes respond with the back end as well as gettng that linked to auth0 will set your application up for success.

## Architecture
We ended up using auth0, React, GitHub, and some jwt tokens.

## Change Log
Made changes code to make sure it had poper routing to link to the back end.
